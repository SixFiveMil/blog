			<p>Another day, another coding challenge! Day 3 of #AdventOfCode 2024 brought a unique blend of problem-solving and programming finesse with the puzzle titled <strong>&ldquo;Mull It Over.&rdquo;</strong> This challenge tested not only my ability to write efficient code but also my skills in managing dynamic logic while parsing tricky input.</p>
<h3 id="-the-challenge-two-parts-one-goal">🧩 The Challenge: Two Parts, One Goal</h3>
<p>The premise was simple on the surface but layered with complexity as the puzzle progressed.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> The goal was to extract valid mul(X,Y) instructions from a corrupted memory dump and sum their results. Valid instructions followed a precise format, while corrupted fragments needed to be ignored. For instance, valid instructions like mul(44,46) needed to be identified, whereas invalid ones like mul(6,9! or mul(32,64] were to be skipped.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Just as I was getting comfortable with Part 1, Part 2 upped the stakes! Here, new commands, do() and don&rsquo;t(), were introduced to dynamically enable or disable the processing of subsequent mul instructions. This required not just identifying valid instructions but also handling state changes in real-time.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-how-i-solved-it">💻 How I Solved It</h3>
<p>You can check out my full solutions on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/SixFiveMil/Advent_of_Code/tree/main/2024/Day%203">Day 3 Solutions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For Part 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I leaned heavily on <strong>Regular Expressions (RegEx)</strong> to filter out valid mul(X,Y) instructions.</li>
<li>The challenge here was crafting a pattern robust enough to ignore corrupted fragments while reliably extracting valid instructions. The result was a clean and concise implementation for parsing and summing up the products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Part 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, I attempted to adapt my RegEx solution to account for the new do() and don&rsquo;t() commands. However, this approach quickly ran into issues when it came to handling dynamic state changes.</li>
<li>My solution pivoted to a more interactive approach:I processed the memory dump line by line.I introduced a state flag that toggled processing based on encountering do() (enabled) or don&rsquo;t() (disabled).When don&rsquo;t() appeared, I paused collecting results, and when do() appeared, I resumed. This inline processing method ensured accurate handling of the conditions without overly complicating the logic.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-what-i-learned">🔑 What I Learned</h3>
<p>Every Advent of Code challenge offers valuable lessons, and today’s puzzle was no exception. Here are some key takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Power of RegEx:</strong> When dealing with unstructured data, RegEx can be a lifesaver. However, it’s important to know its limits—complex state-based conditions often require complementary approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Problem-Solving:</strong> Part 2 was a reminder that not every problem can (or should) be solved in a single pass. Embracing dynamic, state-driven logic helped me overcome the challenge efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Patience and Persistence:</strong> Debugging edge cases with state management can be tedious, but it’s incredibly satisfying when the solution finally clicks.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="-reflections-and-strategies">🎯 Reflections and Strategies</h3>
<p>This challenge wasn’t just about writing code—it was a reminder of why I love puzzles like these. They push me to think critically, adapt to new constraints, and refine my skills in both familiar and unfamiliar areas.</p>
<p>One aspect that stood out today was the importance of <strong>breaking the problem into manageable pieces.</strong> By solving Part 1 independently and then focusing on the additional requirements of Part 2, I was able to avoid overwhelming complexity and maintain clarity in my implementation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-looking-ahead">🚀 Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>Day 3’s puzzle was a fun mix of analytical problem-solving and practical coding skills. I’m excited to see what Day 4 has in store—each day feels like a mini-adventure, with new twists to keep us on our toes!</p>
<p>For anyone following along:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re struggling with similar problems, remember that pivoting your approach isn’t a setback—it’s part of the process.</li>
<li>Share your strategies and experiences! How are you tackling this year’s Advent of Code?</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow my progress on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/SixFiveMil/Advent_of_Code/tree/main/2024/Day%203">Day 3 Solutions</a>) and let’s keep the conversation going.</p>
<p>Here’s to another day of learning, coding, and growing. 🎄💻 #CodingLife #ProblemSolving</p>
